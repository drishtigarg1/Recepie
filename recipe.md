For the fried potatoes
Peel and cut the potatoes into long strips, similar to French fries. Once done soak them in water set aside.
In a pan place the cut potatoes only along with some salt. Pour water and over medium flame bring the potatoes to a boil.
Once the water starts to boil, lower the flame and cook the potatoes for 5 minutes, this step will allow the potatoes to soak all the salt and it will help us in making them extra crispy.
Once the potatoes are ready, strain the potatoes using a strainer and transfer the potatoes into a large mixing bowl.

RECIPE NOTES :
Notes:
We have to dry coat the potatoes so that the wet coating sticks to the potatoes evenly.
The batter has to be thick consistency.
Tomato ketchup helps to balance the flavor of the sauce.
Adding slurry to the sauce will thicken the sauce and it will ensure even coating of the potatoes. You can skip the slurry, but use less water.
